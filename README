Monty is a language ahead of Python.

A preprocessor, generating Python language.

Monty is much simpler than Python:
- no self
- only objects, no functions (only methods)
- no globals in the language (only attributes of a programmer defined global object, if necessary)
- less syntactic sugar and more visual: program structure by indentation and blank lines
-- no ';'
-- no 'class' keyword
-- no parens for superclasses
-- etc.
- no need to import (inferred, with disambiguation in a separate file if necessary.)

In other words, the object-oriented parts of Python, without the procedural programming parts

Inspired by Eiffel, Smalltalk, Lisp
